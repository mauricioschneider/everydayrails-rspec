== README

This repo provides with a step-by-step version of the source code used in the book [https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec](Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec) instead of having the final code for each chapter like the official repo does.  
There's a tag for both the start and end of each chapter.
